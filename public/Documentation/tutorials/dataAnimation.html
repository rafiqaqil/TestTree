<p>There are a number of chart animation types. Some are aesthetic while others have functional value. One functional
    scenario is when updating series data points in real-time, animation provides a context for what is changing. A line
    series may have points added at the end or have certain point values change and if the line animates this change
    correctly, it is immediately understandable what change has occurred.
</p>
<p>When using the FP API to update a series by adding, updating or removing points, the chart will automatically animate
    the change based on this operation.</p>
<span class="codeText">
	chart.series(0).points.add({/*…*/}); // point is added
</span>

<p>This is not always a practical interface to use when updating points. Most of the time, there is just a new list of
    values that must be plotted.
</p>

<p>JSCharting provides a clean way to easily accomplish this. The only thing that is needed is that points are given an
	'id' value that identifies them. For example, the <a href="Samples.masterDetail">masterDetail</a> sample uses this approach to animate the days of the
    month when they change. The points have id values such as 'p1'-'p31' and values are updated with code such as:
</p>

<span class="codeText">
	chart.series(0).options({points:[{id:'p1', x:'1/1/2020', y:23}, /*...*/]});
</span>
<p>The chart automatically updates each day, removes days if the month has fewer, or adds additional days when the
    month has more. If a point with matching id exists, the existing point visual with that id will animate.
</p>

<p>This id binding extends to series as well. Multiple series can be defined and animated at the same time through a
    chart options() call.</p>

<span class="codeText">
	chart.options({series:[ {id:'s1', points:[{id:'p1', y:5}]}]});
</span>


<p>This will remove all other series and points except the p1 point and animate it. To only update this point without
    removing others, code such as this can be used:</p>

<span class="codeText">
chart.series('s1').points('p1').options({y:5});
</span>
<p>If there is no confusion about which series p1 is in, this will work as well:</p>

<span class="codeText">
	chart.series().points('p1').options({y:5});
</span>

<h2>Individual vs. Connected Points</h2>
<p>Using id binding to animate points works automatically when dealing with individual point visuals like columns. When
    the points are connected to each other, as in the case of line series, it becomes slightly more difficult because id
    binding only adds points to the end of the series and x value sort order is not enforced. However, if necessary, the
    splice() function can be used to insert points into the series at any position.

</p>

<span class="codeText">
	chart.series('s1').points.splice(0, [{/*…*/}]);
</span>
