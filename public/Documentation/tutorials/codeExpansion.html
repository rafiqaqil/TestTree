<!-- This tutorial explains how chart settings can be written more efficiently by
using shortcuts.<br />
<br />-->
<p>JS configuration settings used by the chart follow an object oriented
    API to define settings that span a hierarchy of logical chart objects. For
    example an axis tick label can be set by using the following:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
		yAxis:{
		defaultTick:{
		label:{
		text:&#39;%value&#39;
		}
		}
		}
		}</span>
<p>This setting is defined deep within the hierarchy and is a fairly standard
    approach in such a scenario. JSCharting however provides a mechanism
    that makes applying such settings simpler. This is achieved by using
    a single property setting that concatenates all subsequent properties into one name and is used at the root level like so:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
		yAxis_defaultTick_label_text:&#39;%value&#39;
		}</span>
<p>This setting will be evaluated by the chart into the fully expanded code
    shown above.</p>

<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>Due to this approach, it is possible to define the same property
    multiple times. For example the following code specifies the same
    setting twice:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
		label:{text:&#39;textA&#39;},
		label_text:&#39;textB&#39;
		}</span>
<p>In this instance, the more expanded property takes precedence and
    overwrites the aliased version. Running this configuration through the chart will
    result in the following setting:</p>
<span class="codeText">{
		label:{text:&#39;textA&#39;}
		}</span>
<p>When label_text is expanded into label.text, and this value is already
    defined, it will be ignored.</p>
<span class="docsNote">When defining chart options to be used as a
		chart template. The chart expands both the chart configuration and 
		template before the settings are merged. Therefore, this precedence does 
		not influence use of templates.</span>
<span class="docsCaution">This feature is not recommended for use with typescript.</span>
<span class="docsCaution">Some properties such as xAxis and yAxis can be
		set with an axis object, or with an array of axis objects. If an array 
		of axes is used and an aliased axis property is set, it may cause 
		problems as it will not be expanded into one of the axis objects in the 
		array but as a property of the array. </span>
