<h1>Calendar Patterns</h1>
<p>Calendar patterns are a collection of time related rules and provide a way to specify complex date patterns such
    as specific days in a week, year, and even time intervals. For example:</p>

<span class="codeText">
    // The fifth of February.
{month:2, day:5}
</span>

<p>See the <a href="Types.calendarPattern">calendarPattern API</a> for a complete list of available filters.
</p>

<h2>Filter Settings
</h2>
    <p>The month filter is used below to demonstrate values all filters accept. </p>

    <h3>Value</h3>
    <span class="codeText">
        // Matches February.
    {month:2}
    </span>

    <h3>Date</h3>
    <span class="codeText">
         // This is equivalent to the value 2 because
        // only the month part extracted from it.
    {month:'2/1/20'}
    </span>

    <h3>Multiple Values</h3>
    <span class="codeText">
        // February and May.
    {month:[2,5]}
    </span>

    <h3>Range</h3>
    <span class="codeText">
         // February , March, April, and May.
    {month_range:[2,5]}
    </span>

    <h3>Asterisk</h3>
    <span class="codeText">
        // Means every month and puts the pattern into interval mode.
    {month:'*'}
    </span>

    <h3>Function</h3>
    <span class="codeText">
       // A custom function to match months of given dates.
    {
        month:function(date){
        /*return true if date matches*/
        }
        }

    </span>
    <p>In addition to filters, there are also two properties: every and inclusive that are described in more detail below.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>The API for these patterns is robust and easy to read. For example,  a pattern that covers weekends can be defined as:</p>

    <span class="codeText">
    {weekday:[0,6]}
    </span>

    <p>Multiple filters can be used to restrict the pattern range. The addition of the month filter changes the meaning
        to weekends in January.
    </p>

    <span class="codeText">
    {weekday:[0,6], month:1}
    </span>


    <p>Alternatively, extra filters can expand the pattern by adding the inclusive property. The pattern below describes
        all weekends and all days in January.</p>
    <span class="codeText">
    {weekday:[0,6], month:1, inclusive:false}
    </span>

    <p>A more complex example is defining a pattern that marks the first Sunday of every month:</p>
    <span class="codeText">
    {day_range:[1,7], weekday:6}
    </span>

    <p>If a matching pattern is too difficult to define, a custom function can be used as well:</p>
    <span class="codeText">
    {date:function(date){/*Match date*/}}
    </span>

<h1>Intervals</h1>

        <p>An interval pattern that refers to months (every month) can be specified like so:</p>
        <span class="codeText">
        {month:'*'}
        </span>


        <p>This interval pattern covers 100% of any time span but is useful with calendar heatmaps to outline specific date groupings.</p>
        <span class="codeText">
        {month:'*', every:3}
        </span>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>Filters with '*' value can be mixed with other filters, but only one filter can have a '*' value.</p>
