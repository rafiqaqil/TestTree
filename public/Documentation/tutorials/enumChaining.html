<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Enum settings are predefined text options. Enum chaining allows you to use multiple enum values chained
            together in a single setting. Each enum option determines the subsequent enum options that can be
            chained to it. This creates a tree of options and allows expressing settings that would have otherwise
            required multiple properties in an unchained format. For example the chart type property specifies the main
            chart type, but an associated default series type can be included (chained) to it in the same string setting. The goal
            of enum chaining is to reduce the amount of code necessary to specify complex chart types and options.

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p>
    The settings are not case sensitive and spaces are allowed between chained enum settings.
</p>

        <h2>Defaults</h2>
<p>
Enum properties have defaults that are assumed if not specified. For example, a setting for the chart property type
    with no text: <span class="example">&#39;&#39;</span> is equivalent to the
    <span class="example">&#39;vertical&#39;</span> setting.
 </p>
<p>
A setting of <span class="example">&#39;marker&#39;</span> is equivalent to
    <span class="example">&#39;vertical marker&#39;</span><br/>
And <span class="example">&#39;vertical&#39;</span> is equivalent to <span class="example">&#39;vertical line&#39;</span>.
 </p>
<p></p>
Defaults are always implied, so a setting of <span class="example">&#39;pie&#39;</span> is also equivalent
to <span class="example">&#39;pie normal&#39;</span>
