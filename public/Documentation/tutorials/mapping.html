<h2>Mapping Overview</h2>
<p>The JSMapping component is designed to be simple to use for all users; no mapping technology or mapping file format
    experience is required!
    JSMapping ships with specially designed and optimized maps for all world countries, included at no additional
    charge,
    including state and province level maps. For a comprehensive list of supported maps, please see:
</p>
<span class="docsReference">Tutorials.MapList:country, state and province summary list</span>

<p>The API lets users focus on data rather than map files and layers. Intuitive map codes such as <span class="example">&#39;us.ca&#39;</span>
    meaning
    California are used to specify map features to
    associate them with standard data points or series that are the same as those used for any other chart types.
    The files that contain these maps are automatically loaded in the background.
    The <a href="Types.chart.mapping">chart.mapping</a> config options
    offer a number of helpful features such as base layers that allow defining a mapping context that surround the
    specific data point maps without the need of creating data series and styling them. For example, if a chart of
    <span class="example">&#39;us.ca&#39;</span> is used, the baseLayers can be set to <span class="example">&#39;us&#39;</span>
    and will show the surrounding states with a grayed out hue and
    will not affect the chart in any other way.

</p>
<p>With the advanced functionality of JSMapping, many complex internal map data optimizations automatically take place
    behind the scenes to ensure the smallest files for your usage case are automatically selected (which minimizes
    download times and makes your site more responsive). In addition to file selection, JSMapping also automatically
    optimizes map resolution. The end result: maps that look and work better than you would expect with fewer lines of
    code and less work.
</p>


<h2>First Map</h2>
<p>Loading a map in a chart is simple and can be accomplished by setting the <a href="Types.series.map">series.map</a>
    property with a map code.</p>
<span class="codeText">
JSC.chart('chartDiv', {
	type:'map',
	series:[{ map:'us'}]
});
</span>

<p>For a list of map codes and maps see this <a href="Tutorials.mapList">map codes reference</a>.</p>


<h2>Map Layers</h2>
<p>All built in maps are available for use with map charts and referenced by mapCodes. It is not necessary to be aware
    of the actual map files used internally.
    Custom map files are also supported, in both geoJSON and topoJSON formats.
</p>
<span class="docsReference">
	Tutorials.mapCustomFiles
	</span>
<h3>Series and Points from map layers</h3>
<p>The <a href="Types.series.map">series.map</a> property can specify map codes that represent multiple map features
    and <a href="Types.point.map">point.map</a> property can specify map codes with single map features.
    When using the <a href="Types.series.map">series.map</a> property, data points are created for each map feature. For
    example, series[0].map='us'will generate a point for each U.S. state.
</p>


<p>In order to style a specific point of this series, a point with a map property set to 'us.il' can be specified and
    this point object and its settings will be used.</p>
    <span class="codeText">
JSC.chart('chartDiv', {
	type:'map',
	series:[{ map:'us',
		points:[{map:'us.il',color:'blue'}]

		}
		]
});
</span>


<p>If <a href="Types.series.map">series.map</a> property is set to a single feature such as 'us.il' a series with a
    single point is created. Similarly, If a point with map property set to 'us' is created, the point will contain
    only the U.S. Country as a single map feature.

</p>
<h4>Series from map queries</h4>
<p>Maps don't have to be specified using these map feature codes.
    They can also be specified using property filters. For example,
    the following indicates that the series should be based on map
    features in the americas map where the continent property is 'North America'.

</p>
<span class="codeText">JSC.chart('chartDiv', {
	type:'map',
	series:[{
		map:'americas.continent:North America'
	}]
});</span>

<p>This will create a series of points where each point is a North American country outline.
</p>


<p></p>


<h2>Maps with context</h2>
<p>Map layers that are loaded for context can be specified through the mapping.base.layers property.</p>
<span class="codeText">

JSC.chart('chartDiv', {
	type:'map',
    mapping_base_layers:'americas',
	series:[{ map:'us'}]
});
</span>

<h3>Base Layers</h3>
<p>Base layers can be specified through a list of country codes. This creates internal series with specialized behavior.
    These series do not influence the view bounds, and are not included in the legend. The purpose of these layers is to
    create context for maps and shows a continuation of landmasses. It can also be used to load custom map files which
    can then be used to build a series of points that refer to specific features of that custom map data. For example a
    map file with all us state capitals can be loaded as a base layer, then a series of just a few points that refer to
    specific capitals through the point.map property and include weather info. This will create a map that zooms in on
    only these few points.
</p>
<span class="docsReference">Samples.mapWeatherAU</span>
<p>When using built in maps, baseLayers do not have to be used in order to reference them in series and point map
    properties. Loading these maps is automatic.
</p>
<p>Styling and settings for these base layers can be set through the mapping.base.series property.
</p>

<h2>Interactivity</h2>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Map charts have zooming enabled by default. This adds a zoom toolbar that can be clicked to zoom in and out.
</p>
<p>Zooming can be limited by setting the zoomLimit property. This example limits the zoom to 500% of the initial zoom
    level.
</p>
<span class="codeText">chartConfig.mapping_zoomLimit=5;</span>
<p>To disable zooming, set the <a href="Types.chart.axisToZoom">axisToZoom</a> property to 'none'
</p>
<span class="codeText">chartConfig.axisToZoom='none';</span>
<p>This will automatically disable the zooming toolbar as well.
    To disable only the zooming toolbar use:
</p>
<span class="codeText">chartConfig.toolbar_items_zoom_visible=false;</span>
<p>When the chart is zoomed in, the resetZoom toolbar item appears. This can be disabled with:
</p>
<span class="codeText">chartConfig.toolbar_items_resetZoom_visible=false;</span>
<p>The default position of the resetZoom button may overlap other uiItems. Therefore, using a setting like this can help
    correct this:</p>
<span class="codeText">chartConfig.toolbar_items_resetZoom_position='inside top left';</span>
<p></p>
<p></p>


<h3>Zoom and Pan</h3>
<p>An intuitive API is provided for use with zooming operations through the chart.zoom() method.
</p>

<h4>Zoom depth
</h4>
<p>Zoom in a chart to 100% can be accomplished using the following code
</p>
<span class="codeText">chart.zoom(1);</span>

<h4>Pan by</h4>
<p>The current view can be panned by using an array of x and y values in map coordinates to pan the view by
</p>
<span class="codeText">chart.zoom([1,1]);</span>

<h4>Center and zoom</h4>
<p>A map can be centered on a specific coordinate at a specific zoom level by using an array of three items; x, y, and
    zoom level like so:</p>
<span class="codeText">chart.zoom([-91,51,1]);</span>

<h4>Zoom to bbox</h4>
<p>A four item array can be used to specify a bbox to zoom in on.</p>
<span class="codeText">chart.zoom([-91,51,10,15])
</span>

<h4>Get Current view bbox</h4>
<p>Calling chart.zoom without any parameters returns the current view bbox and can be used to calculate the amount of
    the view to pan or restore a map view.</p>
<span class="codeText">var bbox = chart.zoom();</span>

<h4>Zoom features into view</h4>
<p>By passing a map code to the zoom method, the chart will zoom in on that feature.</p>
<span class="codeText">chart.zoom('us');</span>

<h4>Zoom features based on propertyFilters</h4>
<p>By passing a property filter to the zoom method, the chart will zoom in on all matching map features.</p>
<span class="codeText">chart.zoom('us.region:Midwest');</span>

<h3>Events</h3>
<h4>Click Events</h4>
<p>Map click events can be bound to the chart and will have access to clicked lat/long coordinates.</p>
<span class="docsReference">Samples.MapClickPlot</span>

<h3>Map Properties</h3>

<p>Map data properties are loaded as point attributes and are accessible in point related strings through tokens.
</p>
<span class="docsReference">Tutorials.usingLabels:Label and token tutorial</span>
<h3>Built-in Map Properties and Tokens</h3>


<p>A number of standard attribute properties are provided with the native JSCharting maps.
    These attribute tokens can be used with all maps that include such data. They can be used in label as tokens or in
    propertyFilters.</p>
