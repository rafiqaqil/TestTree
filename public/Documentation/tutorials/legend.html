<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The JSCharting legend is a powerful and fully customizable data grid that allows customizing columns with data attributes
	and calculations through the use of expressions. Custom entries can be used to populate the legend with any data or information.
	Some of the legend features include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Flexible and automated positioning</li>
	<li>Legend title
	</li>
	<li>Data columns with expressions
	</li>
	<li>Column headers</li>
	<li>AxisMarker entries</li>
	<li>Custom entries
	</li>
	<li>SmartPalette legend with ColorBar or ranges
	</li>
	<li>Entry icon customization</li>
	<li>Interactivity events</li>
	<li>Chart with only a legend:
		<a href="Samples.LegendAlone">LegendAlone</a>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Layout / Position</h2>
	<p>The legend can be positioned anywhere around the chart area by setting the legend.position property.
		<span class="docsReference">Types.legend.position:Detailed inforation on how to use the legend.position options..</span>

	<!--<p>Legend positioning system is closely tied to annotation and uiItem positioning and offers the following features:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Outside the chartArea on any side.</li>
		<li>Absolute floating x,y position.</li>
		<li>Relative to chartArea origin.</li>
		<li>Docked inside the chartArea.</li>

	</ul>

	&lt;!&ndash;<span class="docsReference">Enums.orientation: A complete list of orientation settings.</span>&ndash;&gt;
<h3>Around the chart</h3>
<span class="codeText">chartOptions.legend_position = &#39;topLeft&#39;;</span>

<p>This positioning can also be used in conjunction with the offset property to make small adjustments:</p>

<span class="codeText">chartOptions.legend_offset = &#39;5,5&#39;;
</span>
<p>A margin property is available to specify the distance between the chartArea and legend when using docked positioning:</p>

<span class="codeText">chartOptions.legend_margin = 5;
	<br/>
</span>
<h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
<p>When absolute positioning is used, the legend will not affect layout of any chart visuals, hence the legend will float on
	top of the chart and position at the specified x,y coordinates relative to the top left of the chart image.
</p>

<span class="codeText">
	//Chart Config: chartOptions.legend_position = &#39;20,10&#39;; //Real-time chart.legends(0).options({position:'100,2'})
</span>
<h3>ChartArea offset</h3>
<p>This is similar to absolute positioning except the 0,0 coordinates refer to the top left corner of the chartArea. For example
	'CA:0,0'. Setting this value to 'CA' will have the same effect. Including x,y coordinates is not required in this case because
	the margin property can be set to indicate the offset amount.</p>

<span class="codeText">
	//Chart Config: chartOptions.legend = {position:'CA', margin:5}; //Real-time chart.legends(0).options({position:'CA', margin:5})
</span>
<h3>Docked Positioning</h3>
To position the legend inside the chartArea docked to a side or corner use:

<span class="codeText">
	//Chart Config: chartOptions.legend_position = &#39;CA:bottomRight&#39;; //Real-time chart.legends(0).options({position:'CA:bottomRight'})
</span>
-->

<h3>Legend Entry Orientation</h3>
<p>When using a position name such as &#39;topLeft&#39; the legend entries are automatically laid out either vertically or horizontally
	depending on the position. However, with absolute or relative positioning, this setting should be specified with the legend.layout
	property:</p>

<span class="codeText">chartOptions.legend_layout = &#39;horizontal&#39;;
	<br/>
</span>
<!--A static width can be specified for the legend:

<span class="codeText">chartOptions.legend_width = 20;</span>
-->

<h2>Styling</h2>

Styling the legendbox is similar to styling the title and annotations. Properties such as
<a href="Types.legend.fill">fill</a>,
<a href="Types.legend.outline">outline</a>,
<a href="Types.legend.radius">radius</a>,
<a href="Types.legend.shadow">shadow</a> are all available.

<span class="docsReference">Types.legend: Legend object properties.</span>

<span class="docsTasks">
	Tasks.Legend.Styling
</span>
<h2>Entries</h2>
Legend entries represent data on the chart. Series have individual legendEntry properties but the legend object has a defaultEntry
property that specifies the defaults for all entries and is recommended unless entry specific customization is required.

<span class="docsSample">SeriesLegendEntry: Specifies series specific legend entry properties.</span>
<h2>Data Grid</h2>
<p>The
	<a href="Types.legend.template">legend.template</a> property can be populated with a space or comma delimited string of expressions and tokens that define
	the data shown for each column.</p>

<p>The legendEntry value and name properties can contain tokens and expressions as well. By default, when the legend template
	includes
	<span class="example">&#39;%name&#39;</span> or
	<span class="example">&#39;%value&#39;</span>, it refers to these properties rather than
	<span class="example">&#39;%name&#39;</span> and
	<span class="example">&#39;%value&#39;</span> of the actual target item. The default values of these properties are
	<span class="codeText">
		{name:'%name', value:'%sum'}
	</span>
	These properties are useful because they allow customizing the data shown for each legend column on a per entry basis. Items
	represented by the legend are not necessarily of the same type. For example, the legend can contain series and point entries
	at the same time.</p>

<span class="docsSample">LegendDataGrid</span>


<p>The
	<a href="Types.legend.header">legend.header</a> property can be used to specify labels for each column defined in
	<a href="Types.legend.template">legend.template</a> property. It too is delimited by spaces or commas if commas are found in the string. The header property
	must contain the same number of items as the template.</p>

<p>Arbitrary token values can also be used in the template and custom text for those tokens can be specified for each legend
	entry like so:</p>

<span class="codeText">
	{template:'%name %icon %value %customVal', name:'%name', value:'%sum', attributes:{'customVal':'Custom Text'}}
</span>


<h3>Data series and points</h3>
<p>By default, each series gets an entry in the legend. However when a series has a palette property set, a legend entry for
	each point of the series is added in place of the series legend entry.</p>
<p>When series have entries in the legend a particular point entry can be added to the legend by setting the points legendEntry_visible
	to true. Similarly, any series legend entry can be removed from the legend by setting its legendEntry_visible to false.</p>
<h3>SmartPalette</h3>
<p>When a chart.palette property is set with a smartPalette config object, the legend will show a ColorBar by default. If the
	smartPalette options define color ranges, the legend will display these ranges instead.</p>
<h3>AxisMarkers</h3>
<p>AxisMarkers entries are added to the legend by default as well. These can be removed by setting their legendEntry_visible
	property to false.</p>
<h3>Custom entries</h3>
<p>Custom legend entries can be added to the legend through the legend.customEntries property. Tokens used with custom entries
	are evaluated using the series collection token list which refers to series on the chart. </p>
<h2>Customizing Entries</h2>
<h3>Column Text</h3>
<p>Legend template property defines columns for a legend that apply to all entries. Custom entries can define custom text for
	columns by adding them to the entry.attributes property. </p>
<span class="docsSample">LegendAxisMarkers</span>
<h3>Icon</h3>
<p>The legend entry icon is fully customizable. Any icon from the icon library can be specified, or even an svg path can be
	specified. The chart will scale the given path to the appropriate size to fit it in the legend.</p>

<!--<h2>Labels</h2>
Legend entry labels support series tokens providing the ability
to describe the data in a robust way without using label callback
functions or series specific legend entry settings.

<span class="codeText">chartOptions.legend_defaultEntry_text = &#39;%name (%sum)&#39;;</span>

<span class="docsSample">LegendTokens</span>

<span class="docsReference">Tutorials.tokenReference: A complete list of available tokens.</span>
<span class="docsTasks">
    Tasks.Legend.Label
</span>-->
<!--<h2>Layout</h2>
As mentioned previously, legend entries can be laid out either
vertically or horizontally. A width can be specified for each entry as
well as entry <a href="Types.legendEntry.padding">padding</a> and
<a href="Types.legendEntry.iconWidth">iconWidth</a>. This can be used to achieve a
multi-column grid layout of entries. When entries lay out horizontally but legend
width is set and not sufficient for all entries, they wrap to the next
line. By setting a static width for each entry, a width for the legend
and using horizontal layout, a grid layout can be achieved as
demonstrated in the following sample:

<span class="___Sample">LegendBoxGrid</span>
<span class="docsTasks">
    Tasks.Legend.Layout
</span>-->
<h2>Sorting</h2>
Legend entries are listed in the order their series are added to the chart. However, setting legend.reverse reverses the
order of the entries. A custom sort order can also be implemented by setting the
<a href="Types.legendEntry.sortOrder">sortOrder</a>
property of individual series legend entries.

<span class="docsSample">LegendEntryOrder</span>

<h2>Events &amp; Interactivity</h2>
<p>By default, legend entries are interactive and when clicked they provide a useful action depending on what the entry represents.
	These behavior can also be disabled by adding a click event handler that returns false.</p>
<p>In general, legend entries represent series and in standard charts clicking the legend entry toggles the corresponding series
	visibility. However, legend entries can also show points, axis marker, and custom entries.
</p>
<p>Point entry click event action can differ between chart types. For example, a pie chart where entries represent slices can
	highlight or explode the pie slice. With standard types like line, column and zooming enabled or with organizational type,
	clicking a point entry can scroll the point into view.
</p>
<p>Entries can also be customized with event handlers to perform any desired actions. With custom legend entry icons, legend
	entries can even be used as clickable buttons similar to uiItems. Sample
	<a href="Samples.MapEntryZoom">MapEntryZoom</a> demonstrates this using a custom entry to reset zoom that appears after a country entry is clicked. It
	also demonstrates how clicked entries can be highlighted (made bold) programmatically.
</p>

<span class="docsSample">LegendEvents: Hooks into the legend entry click and confirms whether the default show/hide series behavior should be executed.</span>

<h2>States</h2>
Legend entries are clickable and therefore visual states are provided to indicate when mouse hovers or the entry is disabled.
The two entry states are named &#39;hover&#39; and &#39;hidden&#39;.

<span class="docsSample">LegendStyling: Demonstrates styling of legend entry states.</span>

Legend entries support cascading states which means that if a setting is applied to the normal state, it will affect subsequent
states like hover and hidden. Internally this cascading processes higher level setting and modifies it to reflect the new
state more accurately unless otherwise specified. This may help reduce the amount of code necessary to achieve an obviously
desired effect. For example, setting a font propagates that font to subsequent states.
