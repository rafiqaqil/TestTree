<h2>Gauge types</h2>
<p>Circular gauge types provide many features with flexibility to create a wide range of visualizations. The radial
	charts support virtually all the same axis features as normal charts except they are curved around a circle.
</p>

<h3>Classic Gauges</h3>
<p>When the chart type property is set to 'gauge', classic needle gauges are used by default. Internally the default
	series type is set to marker and defaultPoint.marker.type is set to 'needle'. When different series/marker
	types are specified, modern gauges are used. Needle lengths and ranges can be controlled by the point.marker.length
	property.
</p>

<span class="docsReference">
	Samples.Gauge:Demonstrates setting needle lengths and ranges.
</span>

<p>Size of the center needle base cap of the gauge that needles start from can be modified through the
	shape.innerPadding property like so:
</p>

<span class="codeText">
{
	defaultSeries_shape_innerPadding:.5
}
</span>

<p>To make the cap smaller, positive values from 0 to 1 can be used. Negative values will make it larger.</p>

</p>

<h3>Modern Gauges</h3>
<p>Modern gauges are standard horizontal charts projected around a circle or arc. All axis features are
	supported just like with standard charts but some default settings may differ between standard and different
	circular chart types. For example, x axes are not visible by default on circular gauges but all x axis visuals can be enabled.
</p>

<span class="docsReference">
	Samples.CircularGrid: Shows all visual elements of both x and y axes.
</span>

<h3>OnTop Features</h3>

<p>Each axis visual element can be set to render on top of data visuals by setting the onTop property to true. The following
	items include onTop settings to modify where it renders.
</p>


<ul>
	<li><a href="Types.axis">axis</a></li>
	<li><a href="Types.axis.line">axis.line</a></li>
	<li><a href="Types.axisTick">axisTick</a></li>
	<li><a href="Types.axisTick.label">axisTick.label</a></li>
	<li><a href="Types.axisTick.gridLine">axisTick.gridLine</a></li>
	<li><a href="Types.axisMarker">axisMarker</a></li>
</ul>


<p>When axis elements render behind data, the axis line renders on top of grid lines by default, but if
	axis.line.onTop=false is set explicitly it will make gridlines render on top of the axis line.
</p>

<h3>Axis Tick Label Placement</h3>
<p>Outer axis tick labels on circular charts can render inside or outside the circular chartArea using the label.placement
	property. The default placement can differ between gauge types but can also be set explicitly as in this snippet:
</p>

<span class="codeText">
{
	yAxis:{
		defaultTick_label_placement:'inside'
	}
}
</span>
<span class="docsReference">Samples.CircularTickPlacement</span>


<h3>Circular Columns</h3>
<p>Circular columns have some unique behaviors that cater to modern dashboard needs.</p>


<h4>Column Overflow</h4>
<p>When y axis range is 0-100 on a full circle, and the column values are larger than that range (say 200), the visual
	will spiral over top of itself. Columns can spiral this way repeatedly and the shape will not represent the column
	value because 200 will look the same as 300, 400, and so on. However, there is a color cue that indicates the
    number of times the column overlaps itself through a change of the column hue.</p>

</span>


<p>This hue change can be disabled by setting 'column solid' series type.</p>

<h3>Span Axis Origin</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary for a column to span the origin on the axis. For example if axis range is 0-12
	representing a clock and a column must be drawn clockwise between 10 and 2, this can be accomplished by
	setting the point y value with [10,2]. When the first value is larger than the second value, the chart
	will assume the point range should span the axis origin.
</p>

<p>Circular columns don't  support all column shading effects, but they do support roundCaps.</p>

<h3>Grid Line Column Guide</h3>
<p>A common linear or circular column gauge feature is  drawing the full path the column can fill behind it. To
	replicate this visual x axis grid lines can be used. Setting grid line width to 'column' makes
	the grid lines match column widths and caps to replicates this visualization.
</p>

<span class="codeText">
{
	xAxis:{
		defaultTick_gridLine_width:'column'
	}
}
</span>

<span class="docsTip">
To ensure axis tick positions coincide with columns, it is best to use category x axis scales.
	Meaning, points have string x values.
</span>

<h3>Gauge Shape Labels</h3>
<p>Gauges including radar, circular, and linear support labels than can be positioned outside or inside the gauge.
	Multiple labels with different alignments can be used on a single gauge.
</p>

Tip: Using labels with icons can be a useful design approach to make modern looking charts.

<h3>Circular Point Marker Rotation</h3>
<p>Point markers on radars or attached to circular columns don't rotate by default, however, by
	setting marker.rotate='auto'  markers will orient their "up" direction to point away from the circular center.
	Auto rotation can be confusing if used on radars with many different markers, but can be useful in some cases
	as in this sample:

<p>In addition, rotation also supports a numeric angle in degrees.</p>
